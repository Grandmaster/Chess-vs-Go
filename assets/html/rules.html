      The game available on this site is a mix between the classic games of
      Chess and Go(or Weiqi/Baduk). I came up with it when noticing that stones
      are played on points and pieces on squares, so the two games could coexist
      on the same board. This page details the rules of the game
      <strong>that are not part of the basic ruleset of Chess and Go.</strong>
      Of course, in order to play this game, you must at the very least know how
      to play both Chess and Go at the beginner level. To learn online, for
      chess I would recommend <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess</a>, an
      online chess site with many players and a suite of tools to help newcomers
      learn the game. For Go, a similar site is
      <a href="https://online-go.com/">online-go</a>, with both of these sites
      being completely free to join and play. The rest of this page assumes that
      you know the basic rules of both of these games, because all rules of each
      game also apply in this one.

      <h2>Basic game structure</h2>
      <p>
        This section details the moves a player can make during each turn over
        the course of the game. At the beginning:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Turn 1</strong>: With no stones and no pieces on the board,
          your first move must be to place the king on the board. No other move
          will be accepted at this stage. There are rules to placing pieces on
          the board, but they are ignored this turn so that the game may begin.
          To place your king (or any other piece) on the board, click on the
          corresponding piece on your bench, then click on the square you want
          to place your piece on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Early Turns</strong>: At this point in the game, the only
          piece you will have out is your king, so the only moves you can make
          are to either move your king to a different square, or place a stone
          on the board. To place a stone, click on the destination point. To
          move your king (or any other piece), click on the piece, then click on
          one of the highlighted squares that indicate its range.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With at least one Zone on the Board</strong>: When you have
          one or more zones on the board (more on them below) you gain the
          ability to place a piece from your bench on the board. You can only
          place pieces from your bench onto zones you control. To place a piece,
          click on the piece, then click on any square that is a zone you
          control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With at least one Enemy Piece/Stone on the Board</strong>: You
          can capture enemy pieces and capture/destroy enemy stones with your
          pieces/stones. There are many ways to do this, which will be explained
          below.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With a few exceptions, you can only do one of these things per turn. The
        game ends when your king is killed (there is no check).

      <h2>Pieces</h2>
      <p>
        This section details the extra abilities chess pieces have in this game,
        in addition to their normal abilities. They usually relate to
        interactions with stones on the board.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <div class="tile is-ancestor">
          <div class="tile is-parent is-vertical">
            <div class="tile is-parent">
              <div class="tile is-child is-6">
                <li>
                  <strong>King</strong>: In addition to his normal abilities,
                  whenever the king moves from one square to another, it can
                  move a friendly stone on one of the corners of the landing
                  square to an empty corner on the same square. The king can
                  basically move stones already placed on the board, and it is
                  the only piece that can do so.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Official</strong>: In addition to all their other
                  abilities, when an official moves from one square to another,
                  it has the ability to convert an enemy stone on a corner of
                  its landing square to a friendly stone.

                <li>
                  <strong>Pawn</strong>: In addition to all its normal
                  abilities, the pawn can capture stones diagonally. That means
                  that the pawn can capture a stone that shares a corner with
                  both its starting square and its landing square if the pawn
                  were to capture diagonally. Also, pawns can move one step in
                  any cardinal direction. Refer to images on the side.

      <h2>Stones</h2>
      <p>
        This section details the extra abilities stones have in this game, in
        addition to their inherited abilities. They relate to the way stones
        interact with pieces in the game.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <div class="tile is-ancestor">

                <li>
                  <strong>Zones</strong>: Stones can form zones on squares on
                  the board. A square becomes a zone of a player if the square
                  either has four stones of the player's color on all four
                  corners, or a corner is a point that exists as territory (the
                  Go kind) belonging to the player. A piece is immediately
                  captured if it exists in a zone of the opposite color. Refer
                  to images.

                <li>
                  <strong>Walls</strong>: When two stones of the same color are
                  adjacent to each other, they form a wall that can restrict the
                  ranges of pieces. Refer to images.

                <li>
                  <strong>Empty Triangle</strong>: A stone that forms the corner
                  of an empty triangle cannot be captured by a pawn, or jumped
                  over by a king.
